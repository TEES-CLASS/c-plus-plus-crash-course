# Chapter 7: The basics of objects using `class` and `struct`
Before we can start to use some common functionality available in c++ we have to overview the creation of customized data-structures. For this we will pretend to be aggressively interested in defining our own implementation of a mathematical vector of real numbers.

## Objectives
- To learn how to define custom types by using either `struct` or `class`.

## 7.1 The basic syntax of `struct`
The basic syntax for `struct` is:
```c++
struct MathVector
{
    
};
```
